In this course, you will learn the fundamentals of how to develop modern cloud-native microservices with Payara Micro and MicroProfile.

MicroProfile is a specification for building microservices architecture. MicroProfile was derived from Jakarta EE, formerly Java EE, and thus allows developers to migrate and reuse their existing Java EE code seamlessly in modern microservice applications. It delivers application portability of microservices across multiple MicroProfile vendor frameworks such as Payara Micro, Helidon, Quarkus, Open Liberty, and TomEE.
