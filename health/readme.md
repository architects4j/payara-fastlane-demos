# MicroProfile generated Application

## Introduction

MicroProfile Starter has generated this MicroProfile application for you.

The generation of the executable jar file can be performed by issuing the following command


    mvn clean package

This will create an executable jar file **health-microbundle.jar** within the _target_ maven folder. This can be started by executing the following command

    java -jar target/health-microbundle.jar

## Specification examples

By default, there is always the creation of a JAX-RS application class to define the path on which the JAX-RS endpoints are available.

Also, a simple Hello world endpoint is created, have a look at the class **HelloController**.

### Fault tolerance

Add resilient features to your applications like TimeOut, RetryPolicy, Fallback, bulkhead and circuit breaker. Specification [here](https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-fault-tolerance)

The example class **ResilienceController** has an example of a FallBack mechanism where an fallback result is returned when the execution takes too long.

### Health

The health status can be used to determine if the 'computing node' needs to be discarded/restarted or not. Specification [here](https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-health)

The class **ServiceHealthCheck** contains an example of a custom check which can be integrated to health status checks of the instance.  The index page contains a link to the status data.
